        Time Till is <em>the</em> modern timer.
    </p>
    <h1><em>Please</em>, get a better browser!</h1>
    <p>This website uses many <em>modern</em> web technologies which work in only the <em>latest</em> of browsers, and in neither
        <b style="color: red">Internet Explorer</b> nor <b style="color: red">Microsoft Edge</b>. That's why you were presented
        with this bland page.</p>
    <p>I recommend you get a better, more <em>secure</em> browser -- like the latest version of <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html"
            style="color: green">Google Chrome</a>, not just to view this website but also to increase your internet satisfaction.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/fiercedeity-productions/timetill">You can still go to the GitHub page and check out the project there.</a></p>
