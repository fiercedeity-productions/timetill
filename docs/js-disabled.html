    <p>This site requires JavaScript to function -- that's why you were presented with this bland page.</p>
    <p>If you are using <b style="color: red">Internet Explorer</b> or <b style="color: red">Microsoft Edge</b>, <em>please</em>,
        upgrade to a better browser. I recommend <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html" style="color: green">Google Chrome</a>.
        Even after enabling JS, the website will still not work as it utilises many <em>modern</em> web technologies.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/fiercedeity-productions/timetill">You can still go to the GitHub page and check out the project there.</a></p>
